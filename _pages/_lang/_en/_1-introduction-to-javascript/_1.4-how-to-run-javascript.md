# How to Run JavaScript

JavaScript can run directly in a web browser or in other environments like Node.js.
Below are the most common and practical ways to execute JavaScript code.

## Run in the Browser Console

Open your browser’s Developer Tools, then go to the **Console** tab.

**Shortcuts:**

- Chrome: `Ctrl + Shift + J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + J` (macOS)
- Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + K` (macOS)

Now type:

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

This is the quickest way to test JavaScript code directly in your browser.

## Run Inside an HTML File

Create a simple HTML file named `index.html` and insert your JavaScript code inside a `<script>` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>JS Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      alert('Hello, World!')
      console.log('Hello, console!')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Save the file and open it in any web browser.
An alert box will appear, and the message will also be printed in the console.

## Use an External JavaScript File

Separate your JavaScript code into its own file.
Create `script.js`:

```js
console.log('External JS running fine!')
```

Then link it to your HTML file like this:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

Open `index.html` in your browser — your external script will execute automatically.

## Run JavaScript with Node.js

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, open a terminal and type:

```bash
node
```

Then write JavaScript directly in the REPL:

```js
console.log('Hello from Node!')
```

Or save it to a file named `app.js` and run:

```bash
node app.js
```

You’ll see the same output in your terminal.

JavaScript can run virtually anywhere — browsers, servers, desktops, even IoT devices —
but the basics always start here: **a console, a script tag, or Node.js.**
