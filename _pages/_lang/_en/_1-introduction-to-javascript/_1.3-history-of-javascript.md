# The History of JavaScript

The history of JavaScript is almost as strange as the language itself.
Over the last 25 years, it has grown from a rushed prototype for Netscape into the most widely used programming language in the world.

## Let There Be JavaScript (1990–1999)

**1990** — The first modern web browser, _WorldWideWeb_ (later renamed _Nexus_), is developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in Switzerland.
**1991** — The High Performance Computing Act (the "Gore Bill") is passed in the U.S., indirectly funding the early web.
**1993** — Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina create the _Mosaic Browser_ at the University of Illinois, the first mainstream web browser.
**1995 (early)** — Netscape, co-founded by Andreessen, dominates the browser market and seeks a lightweight scripting language for dynamic pages.

**May 1995** — Brendan Eich is hired to implement a new language quickly. Under heavy pressure, he builds a prototype in just ten days.
He names it **Mocha**, combining syntax from Java, functions from Scheme, types from Lisp, and prototypes from Self.

**Sept 1995** — Renamed **LiveScript** for marketing.
**Dec 1995** — Renamed again to **JavaScript** (also for marketing).
**1996** — Microsoft releases **JScript** in Internet Explorer 3 after reverse engineering JavaScript.
**1997** — ECMA International standardizes JavaScript as **ECMAScript 1 (ES1)** under the TC-39 committee.
**1998** — **ES2** is approved with minimal changes.
**1999** — **ES3** introduces strict equality, exception handling, and other key features that last for the next decade.

## The Dark Ages (2000–2008)

**2000** — The dot-com bubble bursts, stalling innovation.
In parallel, the **ES4** proposal emerges, aiming to add classes, types, and enterprise features. Critics, including Douglas Crockford, argue it’s too complex.

The TC-39 committee attempts to develop **ES3.1** (simplified) and **ES4** (advanced) in parallel, but ES4 ultimately fails.

Meanwhile, Microsoft’s **Internet Explorer** dominates with ~90% market share, introducing proprietary features and defining its own JS quirks.
**AJAX** becomes popular, paving the way for single-page applications.

**2006** — John Resig creates **jQuery**, solving painful cross-browser issues and setting a new usability standard for developers.
**2008** — Google releases **Chrome** with the open-source **V8 engine**, revolutionizing JS performance.

## The Renaissance (2009–2015)

**2009** — Ryan Dahl builds **Node.js** using the V8 engine, enabling server-side JavaScript and introducing the _JavaScript Everywhere_ movement.

**Dec 2009** — Ten years after ES3, **ES5** is released with strict mode, accessors, and JSON support.

**2010** — Frameworks like **AngularJS** and **Backbone** appear, fueling the rise of modern single-page applications (SPAs).
**2013** — Facebook releases **React**, popularizing declarative UI patterns and virtual DOM rendering.

In the same period, numerous frameworks emerge — **Angular**, **Ember**, **Meteor**, **Sails**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, **Mithril**, **Knockout**, and more — marking JavaScript’s explosion across the stack.

## Modern Times (2015–Present)

**2015** — **ES6 (ES2015)** arrives, the largest language update ever.
It introduces `let`/`const`, arrow functions, classes, promises, modules, and other features inspired by ES4.
Transpilers like **Babel** and languages like **TypeScript** appear, bridging modern syntax with older browsers.

**2016 (ES7)** — Adds `Array.includes()` and begins the annual update cycle.
**2017 (ES8)** — Introduces `async/await`.
**2018 (ES9)** — Adds rest/spread operators for objects.
**2019 (ES10)** — Delivers more small but practical improvements.

## What’s Next?

JavaScript continues to evolve rapidly — from web to server, desktop, and even embedded systems.
Questions remain: Will **WebAssembly (WASM)** replace JS? Will **microfrontends** reshape the frontend ecosystem?

Time will tell. For now, JavaScript remains the most ubiquitous and adaptable programming language in the world
