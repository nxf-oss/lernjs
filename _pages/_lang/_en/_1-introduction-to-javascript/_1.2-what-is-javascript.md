# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a core web programming language, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactivity on web pages — sliders, alerts, popups, and click events all rely on it.
Beyond browsers, JavaScript also runs in environments like **Node.js** (server-side), **Electron** (desktop apps), and **React Native** (mobile apps)
