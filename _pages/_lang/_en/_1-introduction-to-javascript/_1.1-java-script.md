# JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. It is best known as the scripting language for web pages, but it is also used in many non-browser environments such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is prototype-based, garbage-collected, and dynamic, supporting multiple paradigms including imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming.

JavaScript's dynamic features include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, functions as variables, dynamic script creation (`eval`), object introspection (`for...in`, `Object` utilities), and source-code recovery (`Function.prototype.toString()`).

This section focuses purely on the JavaScript language itself, not APIs or features tied to specific host environments. For APIs specific to web pages, refer to the _Web APIs and DOM_ documentation.

The standards defining JavaScript are the **ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262)** and the **ECMAScript Internationalization API (ECMA-402)**. Once a browser implements a new ECMAScript feature, documentation often appears even before the official publication, typically between stages 3 and 4 of the proposal process.

Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language — JavaScript is **not** "Interpreted Java." Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks of Oracle, but they differ completely in syntax, semantics, and application
